# 🎬 START HERE - AI Video Generation Agent

## ✅ Implementation Complete!

Your AI Video Generation Agent is **fully built and ready to use**. The entire system has been implemented according to the plan.

## 🎯 What You Have

A working web application that transforms text prompts into professional videos:

**Input:** "Make a short engaging video on why tennis balls are luminous green"

**Output:** A 30-40 second HD video with:
- AI-generated script
- Professional voiceover  
- Relevant stock footage
- Smooth transitions
- Burned-in captions

## 📋 What You Need to Do (3 Steps)

### Step 1: Install FFmpeg (5 minutes)

FFmpeg is required for video processing.

**Mac:**
```bash
brew install ffmpeg
```

**Linux:**
```bash
sudo apt install ffmpeg
```

**Verify:**
```bash
ffmpeg -version
```

### Step 2: Get API Keys (10 minutes)

You need two API keys:

#### OpenAI (for GPT-4 + Voiceover)
1. Visit: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
2. Sign up and add $5 credit
3. Create API key (starts with `sk-`)
4. **Cost:** ~$0.47 per video

#### Pexels (for Stock Videos)
1. Visit: https://www.pexels.com/api/
2. Sign up (free, no credit card)
3. Get your API key
4. **Cost:** FREE

### Step 3: Configure .env File (2 minutes)

Create a file named `.env` in this directory:

```bash
cd /Users/catchup.life/OpusClip
nano .env
```

Add your API keys and demo password:
```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-actual-openai-key
PEXELS_API_KEY=your-actual-pexels-key
DEMO_PASSWORD=demo2024
SESSION_SECRET=random-secret-string-here
PORT=3000
```

**🔒 Password Protection:** The app now requires login! Default password is `demo2024`. Perfect for sharing with interviewers. See `DEPLOYMENT.md` for details.

Save and exit (Ctrl+X, Y, Enter)

## 🚀 Run It!

Start the server:
```bash
npm start
```

Open your browser:
```
http://localhost:3000
```

Enter a prompt and click "Generate Video"!
